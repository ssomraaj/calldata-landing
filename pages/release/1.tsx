          Delaware, United States of America - eForum (www.eforum.io) is a
          community aggregator platform that is built to be an ecosystem for
          projects on metaverse to build their communities & manage them
          effectively on a mobile first technology. eForum is created by an
          international team of developers who are passionate about exploring
          how open community architecture & social interactions as a whole works
          in the long-term.

        <p className="pt-6 font-light">
          The Social Media industry has made headlines since 2005. Since then,
          many major companies and projects have emerged to make their presence
          known to the public. Due to this trend, the social media industry is
          now one of the biggest driving forces for any business in the world.
        </p>

        <p className="pt-6 font-light">
          But the current state of community building in social networks is a
          roadblocker as we’ve to use multiple platforms to maintain a community
          effectively. Users should leverage features from every platform to
          provide various services to their users. The metaverse is different
          from traditional web2. Hence these web3 organizations need an
          exclusive social network that understands their business model and
          drafts a platform to socially interact with their members including
          DAO token holders, general token holders & users.
        </p>

        <p className="pt-6 font-light">
          NFTs are a revolution, we’ll make sure we take the legacy forward. We
          will make sure that corporate NFT will thrive within our ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p className="pt-6 font-light">
          Additionally eForum is the first ever mobile app that is built for
          web3 platforms to interact with their participants. The combination of
          Web2 & Web3 into the platform empowers web3 companies to thrive in the
          ecosystem. It supports these companies in establishing a proper
          network among their users.
        </p>

        <p className="pt-6 font-light">
          eForum will be launching its mobile application (initially iOS) for
          general public to Q1, 2022, but users who wish to be onboarded to our
          closed beta program can apply on www.eforum.io
